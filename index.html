    <h2>This is a page about Evan Morris.</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Let's start with fun facts:</h3>
    <p>I like to program, <span>do things that are overall creative,</span> I'm a hands-on learner, I like to eat, and I like to do the normal teenage guy stuff.
    <span>To be specific about creative, I like to make music, do art, do photography, write, and etc.</span></p>
    <br/>
    <p>I also really like to learn stuff, especially when I'm passionate about whatever I happen to be interested in.</p>
